        <title>Three Books...</title>
        <additionalInfo>
           Why three? We live in a three-dimensional world, colored with hues that break down into a trio of primary colors. Our souls (according to Plato) and our psyches (according to Freud) are trilithic. Three is a number that allows for conversation, completion, understanding. And so "Three Books..." invites writers to recommend three great reads on a single theme.
